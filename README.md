## üõ† Skills

### üõ° Incident Response and Computer Forensics:
- Conducted Windows-based incident response simulations in DFIR labs using Sysinternals and Eric Zimmerman's tools.  
- Analyzed artifacts such as UserAssist, Prefetch, MFT, Registry Hives and EXIF for user/system activity reconstruction.  
- Performed memory forensics with Volatility and Redline  
- Threat Intelligence Correlation: Utilized platforms like VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB  
- Performed static and dynamic malware analysis in controlled virtual environments, focusing on:  
  - Persistence mechanisms  
  - Code injection techniques  
  - Network communication patterns, including IP fluxing and C2 behavior  
- Defined and optimized Sysmon configuration to selectively log high-value events, such as DNS queries and process creation, enabling targeted log collection and efficient threat hunting  
- Email Header Analysis:  
  - Conducted analysis of email headers (Return-Path, Received, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, Message-ID)

### üîê Information System Security:
- Strong foundation in cryptographic principles: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, MAC, certificates  
- Developed a project on self-signed certificates  
- Completed academic project using ITSRM framework, aligning risk assessment with ISO 27005 standards  
- Conducted information system risk analysis using tools such as Verinice, RMstudio

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Foundations of Privacy and Security
- Solid grasp of GDPR, E-Privacy and EU directives related to data privacy, consent and data subject rights.

### üåê Networking & Traffic Analysis
- Strong understanding of TCP/IP architecture and protocols, DNS, routing, VLANs and network devices (routers/switches).  
- Hands-on experience with Wireshark and tcpdump for packet capture and protocol inspection.  
- Able to detect anomalies and troubleshoot issues through network flow and PCAP analysis

### üí£ Penetration Testing

**Passive Reconnaissance:**  
- Familiar with open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques and tools for passive information gathering, including Spiderfoot, hunter.io, shodan.io and Google Dorking.

**Active Scanning & Enumeration:**  
- Experience with tools such as Nmap, Netdiscover, Nikto, Dirbuster and WPScan for active network and application enumeration.  
- Used Metasploit Framework for exploiting known vulnerabilities and simulating attacks in lab environments.

**Practical Labs & Capture The Flag (CTF) Projects:**  
- Completed hands-on penetration testing exercises using intentionally vulnerable machines:  
  - Raven 1 & Raven 2 (Vulnhub CTF Machines) ‚Äì Performed full kill-chain exploitation: enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation.  
  - Metasploitable 2 ‚Äì Practiced scanning, vulnerability exploitation, and basic post-exploitation techniques in a lab environment.

### üìä SIEM & Intrusion Detection
- Operated Wazuh SIEM for log aggregation, alert correlation and custom Sigma rules deployment (thesis project). [Sigma Rules](https://github.com/TZOYRMANAS/Sigma_rules)
 
- Deployed and maintained Security Onion, integrating Snort, Suricata and Zeek for IDS/IPS and network monitoring  
- Performed PCAP-based detection using Brim and Zeek logs, and utilized Snort/Suricata rules blending signature and anomaly techniques to accurately identify network threats and reduce false positives.
- Integrated alerts monitoring through Squil and leveraged NetworkMiner for detailed packet analysis and incident investigation


### Web Development & Database Management
